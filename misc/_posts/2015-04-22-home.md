Security and Artificial Intelligence Lab works on solving the security issues that may arise in building Machine Learning based systems. Our lab has different independent research groups that work on **Data Poisoning and Reconstruction Attacks, Differential Privacy, Secure Multiparty Computation, and Inference Attacks**. We build algorithms to carry out these attacks as well as defensive architecture to counter the attacks. 

In recent times, we have also been carrying out research to explore the possible applications of **Federated Machine Learning in Healthcare, Cybersecurity, and Intelligent Transportation System**. We empower the diversity and collaborations inside our lab. Our research work is collaborated with eminent researchers from Monash University (Australia), Deakin University (Australia), University of Macedonia(Greece), and University of Salerno(Italy).
